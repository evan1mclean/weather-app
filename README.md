# Weather App
This is a simple weather forecast app made with HTML, SASS, JavaScript, and bundled with Webpack.

The purpose of this app was to practice asynchronous programming and working with APIs. This app utilizes the free Weather API provided by https://openweathermap.org/. Also, while this project wasn't really large enough to warrant using SASS, I really wanted to learn how to use it, so I decided to try it out for this.

This app features
- A search input for your location
- Toggle between metric and imperial units for the data
- A simple display for the weather in your location
